Exploring the Launcher
----------------------

Command line parsing questions

A1. MAX_LINE_LEN and MAX_ARGS are defined, but there is no comparable
definition for the maximum length of a single argument string.  Is that
ok?  Why or why not? (Hint: See the manpage for strtok.)
===Write your answer here:

It is ok, strtok function will return the token for us and strlen will return
the length of the token, plus the program is using dynamic memory allocation,
so it is ok that there is no comparaable definition for the length of a 
single argument string.

A2. Try adding a blank line to the launch_set file and running the
launcher.  Something bad will happen.  Explain and fix this bug. 
(All of the commands in the file should be executed without error.)
===Write your explanation here:

Since the line is empty, the custom struct variable's name and argv are NULL
and the strlen function will crash if we pass in a NULL pointer variable

You can test your bug fix using the command
./launch -test all

Fork and exec questions

A3. Explain what the return value of fork() means and how this program
uses it.
===Write your explanation here:

the return value of fork() is the process id, in parent process, the process id
returned by fork() is the actual provess id of the child process, in child process,
the id returned is 0

the program check pid if it's 0, then means the cureent process is child process,
then the command will be executed

A4. What would happen if this program did not use the fork function, but
just called execv directly?  (You can test your hypothesis: Try changing
line 100 from 'pid = fork();' to 'pid = 0;')
===Write your answer here:

nothing will happen

A5. What is the role of the status variable?
===Write your answer here:

A6. Run './launch launch_set' several times.  You should see some
variation in the output.  What is happening?  Why?
===Write your answer here:

Experimenting with other commands

A7. Try adding a nonexistant command (e.g., "fasdfjaskf" or
"argelfraster") to the launch set.  What happens?  Why?
===Write your answer here:

A8. Try adding the command 'cd ..' to the launch_set file.  What happens?
Why?  (Hint: Learn what the 'which' command does; then try typing 'which
cd' in bash.)
===Write your answer here:

A9. Given what you learned in A6, is the behavior you saw in A8
appropriate?  Is the cd command useful in the launch program?  Why or
why not?
